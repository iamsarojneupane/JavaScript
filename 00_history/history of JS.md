# HISTORY OF WEB BROWSERS
Which was the first browser for public use and who developed it?
### 1. Tim Berners Lee || Computer Scientist
Release WorldWideWeb(1990), developed the first web browser, for the NeXT Computer, coinciding with the creation of the first web server. 

April 1993, “Mosaic” by NCSA (National Centre for Supercomputing Applications) at the University of Illinois. It was originally called Mesh and gained massive popularity as it was the first graphical browser that demonstrated the use of multimedia (images) on the web.

### 2. Netscape Navigator (1994) 
Founded by Marc Andreessen, it was the first widely successful browser for the public.

### 3. Internet Explorer (1995) || Microsoft
Microsoft's browser became dominant, bundled with Windows operating systems.

### 4. Opera (1996) || Opera Software

### 4. Mozilla (1998) 
An open-source alternative to Internet Explorer, evolved into the Mozilla Firefox web browser in 2002 and gaining popularity for its speed and security.

### 5. Google Chrome (2008):
Google's browser quickly dominated the market with its speed and minimalist design.

Also, several other browsers like Brave and Vivaldi came into the game and are used by some users for their unique features.

# Let's talk about the of JavaScript 
JavaScript is one of the most popular scripting or
programming language.

### Brendan Eich || September 1995 
Making the language of web, initially named **Mocha** then **LiveScript** and finally **JavaScript.**

First version of JavaScript standardized by Netscape at in 1997. 

Evolution:
- Version 1 - First release
- Version 2 - Added object-oriented programming features
- Version 3 - Introduced functions as first class citizens
- ECMAScript - Standardization process started on 2015.
- JavaScript 1.8.5 - First implementation of JSON

Nowadays, there are several implementations. The most popular ones are:
- **JavaScript** - Implemented by all modern browsers
- **ActionScript** - Used in Adobe Flash Player
- **JScript .NET** - Used in Microsoft products like Visual Studio
- **JavaScrpt/ECMAScript** - An open standard implemented by many engines including Firefox, Safari, and Google Chrome.
- **JavaScrpt/ECMAScript** - An open standard implemented by many engines including Firefox, Safari, and IE. 

### Jeff Atwood || Founder of Stackoverflow 
- **Atwood's Law**: Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript.

### V8 Engine

- **Chrome**: Mixing both intrepreted and compiled language to optimize speed & performance works on  just in  time(JIT) compilation which means that code is compiled when it’s being executed. 

- **NodeJS**: Running JavaScript on  server side using an event-driven model instead of a callback-based one.  It uses Google’s V8 engine, which is a high-performance JavaScript engines and  WebAssembly. 


### Javascript is an interpreted language or compiled language?
- Well, Javascript is primarily known as an interpreted langauge.
- JavaScript engines has evolved into a combination of both interpreted and compiled language, utilizing a Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation approach. 

- This means that the code is initially interpreted, but during execution, specific parts may be compiled for optimized performance.

### JavaScript dynamic typed language or a statically typed language?

### Dynamically typed languages

- A language is dynamically typed if the type is associated with run-time values, and not named variables/fields/etc. allowing for flexibility in assigning different values to variables during program execution.
- This means that, you as a programmer can write a little quicker because you do not have to specify types every time
(unless using a statically-typed language with type inference).
- Most dynamically typed languages do allow you to provide type information, but do not require it. 

- Examples: Ruby, Python, PHP, Perl, Erlang, JavaScript

One language that is currently being developed **Rascal**, takes a hybrid approach allowing dynamic typing within functions but enforcing static typing for the function signature.

### Statically typed languages

- A language is statically typed if the type of a variable is known at compile time. 
- For some languages this means that you as the programmer must specify what type each variable is, other languages like Java, C, C++ offer some form of type inference, 
- The capability of the type system to deduce the type of a variable (e.g.: OCaml, Haskell, Scala, Kotlin).
- The main advantage here is that all kinds of checking can be done by the compiler, and therefore a lot of trivial bugs are caught at a very early stage.

- Examples: C, C++, Java, Rust, Go, Scala
