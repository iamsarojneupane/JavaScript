A code repo for JavaScript from beginner to your max capacity!
Hello, fellow programming enthusiasts! Today, on February 14, 2024, I'm embarking on a journey to learn JavaScript. I've decided to dive into the world of coding, starting with the JavaScript series with Chai aur Code. My plan is to master JavaScript before venturing into the realm of ReactJS. I'm eager to approach this learning path with discipline and consistency.

Action Step 1: 
Write down your WHY? And Note down your progress.
